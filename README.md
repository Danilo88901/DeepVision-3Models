# DeepVision-3Models
Benchmarking three CNN architectures — ResNet-50, custom Inception-based model (Redmi), and ConvNeXt Tiny — on multi-class image classification tasks with integrated GRAM visualization for model interpretability. The project facilitates performance comparison through accuracy, F1-score, and loss metrics alongside visual attention analysis.
