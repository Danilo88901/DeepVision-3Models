# 🌀 Cassava Leaf Disease Classification with Convex CNN 🌀

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (Convex CNN) to classify cassava leaf diseases.  
The model was trained using transfer learning and optimized for robust performance on the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/overview) from Kaggle.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Cassava is a staple crop in many tropical regions but suffers from several diseases that affect yield and quality.  
This project uses a lightweight CNN (Convex) architecture to classify cassava leaf images into disease categories with high accuracy.

Key features:

- ⚙️ Custom Convex CNN architecture  
- 🧠 Transfer learning applied where appropriate  
- 🎛️ Data augmentation for improved generalization  
- 📈 Tracked training using loss, accuracy, and F1-score
