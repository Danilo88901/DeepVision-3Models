# 🌿 Cassava Leaf Disease Classification with CNN 🌿

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify cassava leaf diseases using transfer learning.  
The model is trained on the [Cassava Leaf Disease Classification dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cassava-leaf-disease-classification/overview).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## 🚀 Project Overview

Cassava is a major food crop in many tropical countries, but it is vulnerable to several diseases which reduce its yield and quality.  
Early and accurate detection of these diseases using machine learning can help farmers take timely action.

This project fine-tunes a pretrained CNN model to classify images of cassava leaves into different disease categories.

🧠 Model Details
Uses transfer learning with a pretrained CNN backbone.

Fine-tunes the classifier head to distinguish between cassava leaf disease classes.

Applies data augmentation to improve generalization.

Tracks training and validation metrics including loss and F1 score.

📊 Results
Achieved high classification performance with a validation F1 score of approximately [your_best_f1_score_here]%.

Training and validation loss decreased steadily over epochs.

Visualization of metrics is available in the plots/ folder.

🔮 Future Work & Improvements
Implement class-wise precision, recall, and confusion matrix visualization.

Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters.

Add model evaluation on unseen test data.

Provide pretrained model weights for inference.
