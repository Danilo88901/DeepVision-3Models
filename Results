### ðŸ“Œ Summary

- ðŸ“‰ **My CNN** showed limited performance due to lack of depth and pretraining, despite using an Inception block.
- ðŸš€ **Convex CNN** delivered the best overall performance, combining transfer learning with an efficient custom architecture.
- ðŸ§  **ResNet50** performed solidly thanks to pretrained features, but did not surpass Convex CNN in this specific task.

ðŸ“Š Training curves for all models (loss, accuracy, F1-score) are saved in the `plots/` folder.
